# Qvain API
-----------

Qvain is a web application for description of metadata based on a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/). It is developed by the [National Library of Finland](https://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/en) as part of the [FairData](https://fairdata.fi/) project.

This repository contains the server backend, written in the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language.

If you are looking for technical information, the `doc/` directory in the source contains a [list of Qvain related links](doc/links.md) as well as a [brief introduction](doc/using_go.md) to setting up Go for those who would like to contribute.
